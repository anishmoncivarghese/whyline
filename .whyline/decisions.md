# Decisions

Append-only. Written by whyline; readable without it.

## 2026-08-14 — Add CodeGraph as the clean-project M0 subject

**Because:** It tests fresh-repository bootstrap and instruction pickup that the three mature repositories cannot exercise

**Rejected:**

- Use only mature repositories — that would leave new-project behavior unmeasured

**Files:** m0/RESULTS.md

## 2026-08-17 — brief.compose falls back to decisions.md when the ledger has no notes

**Because:** ledger.jsonl is gitignored so a fresh clone has an empty ledger but a committed decisions.md; reading only the ledger would silently break cross-machine handoff

**Rejected:**

- read only the ledger — works only on the machine that recorded the notes
- merge both sources — risks duplicate or conflicting entries with no stable id-based dedup guarantee across formats

**Files:** src/whyline/brief.py, src/whyline/decisions.py

## 2026-08-17 — Merge brief's two sources instead of choosing between them

**Because:** the ledger is gitignored and decisions.md is what travels, so a clone plus one local note hid the entire committed history and reported '1 of 1' when there were twenty

**Rejected:**

- read decisions.md only when the ledger is empty — works solely in the pristine clone state, which nobody is in after their first commit
- commit the ledger so brief always has it — puts raw prompt text in git, which the privacy decision forbids

**Files:** src/whyline/brief.py

## 2026-08-17 — Resolve runner injection points at call time, not in the signature

**Because:** default arguments bind at import time, so monkeypatching runner.shutil.which had no effect and a test exec'd the real codex binary, replacing the pytest process

**Rejected:**

- patch the default argument tuple in tests — couples every test to CPython internals

**Files:** src/whyline/runner.py

## 2026-08-18 — The AGENTS.md instruction must say decisions are recorded in addition to any other record-keeping

**Because:** observed 2026-08-18 in CodeGraph: an orchestrated Task 10 produced three commits and zero whyline decisions, while 42 lines of genuinely good reasoning went into the gitignored SDD ledger instead. whyline silently lost to a mechanism already active in the workflow, so the instruction must not read as the only place a record goes

**Rejected:**

- leave the wording as is — it competes implicitly with any active process and loses without signalling anything
- ingest from other ledgers — larger scope, and it would couple whyline to one particular workflow's file format

**Files:** src/whyline/agentsmd.py

## 2026-08-18 — Delegation to another agent should point at whyline brief rather than re-deriving context by hand

**Because:** in the same session Claude hand-wrote a 187-line task brief containing project context it reconstructed manually, then launched codex with it. One line telling codex to run whyline brief would have replaced most of that. The copy-paste problem whyline exists to remove happened at full scale inside a repository where whyline was installed and working

**Rejected:**

- assume agents will think to run brief when delegating — they did not, in the one observation available

**Files:** src/whyline/agentsmd.py

## 2026-08-18 — M0's write-side result is bounded to direct interactive work, not orchestrated workflows

**Because:** M0 measured 19 decisions across 14 commits while agents worked directly with the human. Under an orchestrated flow with its own ledger the same repository recorded zero. The headline rate is therefore workflow-dependent and must be stated that way rather than as a general property

**Rejected:**

- treat the M0 rate as general — it would overstate a result measured under one workflow only

**Files:** m0/RESULTS.md
